## Review Process

### 1. Initial Assessment
```
Quick Scan Checklist:
□ Does the PR have a clear description?
□ Are the changes focused on a single concern?
□ Is the diff size manageable (< 400 lines)?
□ Are tests included/updated?
□ Does CI pass?
```

### 2. Systematic Review
```
Review Order:
1. PR Description & Context
2. Tests (understand intended behavior)
3. Public API Changes
4. Core Logic Implementation
5. Error Handling
6. Performance Implications
7. Security Considerations
8. Documentation Updates
```

### 3. Feedback Prioritization
```
Priority Levels:
🔴 Critical (Must Fix):
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Data loss risks
   - Breaking changes
   - Major bugs

🟡 Major (Should Fix):
   - Performance issues
   - Poor error handling
   - Missing tests
   - Code smells

🟢 Minor (Consider):
   - Style issues
   - Minor optimizations
   - Naming improvements
   - Documentation gaps

💡 Suggestions (Optional):
   - Alternative approaches
   - Future improvements
   - Learning opportunities
```

## Review Criteria Deep Dive

### Functionality Review
```
Questions to Ask:
- Does the code solve the stated problem?
- Are all requirements met?
- Are edge cases handled?
- Is the happy path tested?
- What about error scenarios?

Example Review Comment:
"This implementation handles the base case well, but what happens when 
the user array is empty? Consider adding a guard clause:

if (users.length === 0) {
    return { results: [], total: 0 };
}

This prevents the unnecessary database query and provides a consistent 
response structure."
```

### Readability Review
```
Readability Checklist:
□ Clear variable/function names
□ Functions do one thing
□ Consistent abstraction levels
□ Self-documenting code
□ Minimal comments (code explains itself)
□ No magic numbers/strings

Example Review Comment:
"The function name 'process' is too generic. Consider 'validateAndSaveOrder' 
which clearly indicates both actions. Also, extract the magic number 86400000 
to a constant like MILLISECONDS_PER_DAY for clarity."
```

### Security Review
```
Security Checklist:
□ Input validation on all external data
□ Parameterized queries (no SQL injection)
□ Output encoding (no XSS)
□ Proper authentication checks
□ Authorization at correct level
□ Secrets not hardcoded
□ Dependencies up to date
□ Rate limiting where needed

Example Review Comment:
"⚠️ SECURITY: The user input is directly interpolated into the SQL query 
on line 45. This creates an SQL injection vulnerability. Use parameterized 
queries instead:

const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?';
db.query(query, [userEmail]);"
```

### Performance Review
```
Performance Checklist:
□ Appropriate algorithm choice
□ Database queries optimized
□ Proper indexing considered
□ Caching implemented where beneficial
□ Async operations for I/O
□ Resource pooling used
□ Memory leaks prevented

Example Review Comment:
"This nested loop creates O(n²) complexity. Since you're checking for 
membership, consider using a Set for O(1) lookups:

const validIds = new Set(allowedIds);
return items.filter(item => validIds.has(item.id));"
```

### Testing Review
```
Testing Checklist:
□ Unit tests for business logic
□ Integration tests for workflows
□ Edge cases covered
□ Error scenarios tested
□ Mocks used appropriately
□ Tests are maintainable
□ Good test descriptions

Example Review Comment:
"Great test coverage! Consider adding these edge cases:
1. Empty array input
2. Duplicate entries
3. Maximum array size
4. Non-array input type

Also, the test 'should work' could be more descriptive: 
'should return sorted array in ascending order'"
```

## Common Code Smells and Fixes

### Large Functions
```
// Smell: Function doing too much
async function processUserRegistration(userData) {
    // Validate data (20 lines)
    // Check existing user (15 lines)
    // Hash password (10 lines)
    // Create user (20 lines)
    // Send email (15 lines)
    // Log activity (10 lines)
}

// Review Comment:
"This function has multiple responsibilities. Consider breaking it down:

async function processUserRegistration(userData) {
    const validatedData = await validateUserData(userData);
    await checkUserDoesNotExist(validatedData.email);
    const hashedData = await hashUserPassword(validatedData);
    const user = await createUser(hashedData);
    await sendWelcomeEmail(user);
    await logUserActivity('registration', user.id);
    return user;
}

This makes each step testable and the flow clearer."
```

### Nested Conditionals
```
// Smell: Deep nesting
if (user) {
    if (user.isActive) {
        if (user.hasPermission) {
            if (resource.isAvailable) {
                // Do something
            }
        }
    }
}

// Review Comment:
"Consider using early returns to reduce nesting:

if (!user) return unauthorized();
if (!user.isActive) return userInactive();
if (!user.hasPermission) return forbidden();
if (!resource.isAvailable) return resourceUnavailable();

// Do something

This 'guard clause' pattern improves readability."
```

### Poor Error Handling
```
// Smell: Generic catch-all
try {
    return await processPayment(data);
} catch (e) {
    console.log(e);
    return null;
}

// Review Comment:
"This error handling loses important context. Consider:

try {
    return await processPayment(data);
} catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof PaymentValidationError) {
        logger.warn('Payment validation failed', { error, data });
        throw new BadRequestError(error.message);
    }
    
    logger.error('Payment processing failed', { error, data });
    throw new InternalServerError('Payment processing failed');
}

This preserves error types and provides better debugging info."
```

## Review Comment Templates

### Positive Feedback
```
"✅ Excellent error handling here! The specific error types and detailed 
logging will make debugging much easier."

"👍 Great use of the Builder pattern here. It makes the complex object 
construction much clearer and testable."

"🎯 Nice optimization! Using Map instead of nested loops reduces complexity 
from O(n²) to O(n)."
```

### Constructive Criticism
```
"Consider extracting this logic to a separate function. It would improve 
testability and make the main flow easier to follow.

Current: [code]
Suggested: [refactored code]"

"This works, but there's a more idiomatic approach in our codebase:
[example from existing code]"

"While this implementation is functional, it might face issues at scale. 
Consider [specific improvement] to handle [specific scenario]."
```

### Security Concerns
```
"🚨 SECURITY ISSUE: This exposes sensitive user data in the response. 
Please filter out password hashes and personal information:

return users.map(({ password, ssn, ...safeData }) => safeData);"
```

## Special Review Scenarios

### API Changes
```
Review Focus:
- Backward compatibility
- Versioning strategy
- Documentation updates
- Client impact
- Migration path
- Deprecation notices

Example Comment:
"This API change breaks backward compatibility. Consider:
1. Adding a new endpoint instead of modifying
2. Supporting both formats temporarily
3. Adding deprecation headers
4. Documenting migration in changelog"
```

### Database Migrations
```
Review Focus:
- Rollback capability
- Data integrity
- Performance impact
- Zero-downtime deployment
- Index strategy
- Large table considerations

Example Comment:
"This migration adds an index on a large table. Consider:
1. Running CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY to avoid locks
2. Scheduling during low-traffic period
3. Having a rollback plan ready
4. Testing on production-sized data first"
```

### Security-Critical Code
```
Review Focus:
- Threat modeling
- Input validation completeness
- Output encoding
- Authentication/authorization
- Cryptography correctness
- Audit logging
- Compliance requirements

Example Comment:
"For this authentication code:
1. Add rate limiting to prevent brute force
2. Use constant-time comparison for tokens
3. Add audit logging for failed attempts
4. Consider implementing MFA support"
```

## Mentoring Through Reviews
