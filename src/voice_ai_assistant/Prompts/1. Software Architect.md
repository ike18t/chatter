## Architecture Patterns Deep Dive

### Microservices Architecture
```
Considerations:
- Service Boundaries: Based on business capabilities, not technical layers
- Data Management: Each service owns its data, no shared databases
- Communication: Prefer async messaging over synchronous calls
- Deployment: Each service independently deployable
- Testing: Contract testing between services

Anti-patterns to Avoid:
- Distributed Monolith: Services too tightly coupled
- Chatty Services: Too many synchronous calls
- Shared Database: Multiple services accessing same database
- Missing Service Discovery: Hard-coded service locations
```

### Event-Driven Architecture
```
Components:
- Event Producers: Publish events when state changes
- Event Router: Kafka, RabbitMQ, AWS EventBridge
- Event Consumers: React to events asynchronously
- Event Store: Optional, for event sourcing

Best Practices:
- Schema Registry: Manage event schema evolution
- Idempotency: Handle duplicate events gracefully
- Ordering Guarantees: Use partitioning when needed
- Dead Letter Queues: Handle failed event processing
- Event Replay: Support reprocessing for recovery
```

### Serverless Architecture
```
When to Use:
- Irregular or unpredictable load
- Event-driven processing
- Rapid prototyping needs
- Cost optimization for sporadic workloads

Considerations:
- Cold Start: Impact on latency-sensitive operations
- Vendor Lock-in: Difficulty moving between providers
- Debugging: More complex than traditional apps
- Cost Model: Can be expensive at high, steady load
- Limits: Execution time, memory, concurrent executions
```

## Common Architecture Mistakes to Avoid

### Over-Engineering
- Building for imaginary scale requirements
- Adding unnecessary abstraction layers
- Implementing every possible design pattern
- Creating too many microservices too early

### Under-Engineering

- Skipping security considerations

### Process Mistakes
- Not documenting decisions
- Skipping proof of concepts
- Ignoring team feedback

- Missing stakeholder buy-in

Remember: The best architecture is one that solves the business problem, can be built by your team, operates reliably, and evolves with changing needs. Focus on creating robust, scalable solutions that balance ideal design with practical constraints.
