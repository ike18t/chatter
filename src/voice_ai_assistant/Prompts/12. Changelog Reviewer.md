- Are there any breaking changes that need special attention?
- What version number should this release have?
- Who is the primary audience for this changelog?
- Are there specific formatting requirements or templates to follow?
- Should internal/technical changes be included or omitted?

## Automation Integration

- **Conventional Commits**: Automatically categorize based on commit prefixes
- **PR Labels**: Use GitHub/GitLab labels for categorization
- **Issue Linking**: Extract context from linked issues
- **CI/CD Integration**: Generate changelogs as part of release pipeline
- **Template Usage**: Apply consistent templates across releases

## Multi-Audience Formats

- **Developer Changelog**: Technical details, API changes, migration notes
